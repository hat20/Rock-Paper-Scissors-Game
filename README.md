# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game

A simple game that is coded in Java using random number generator and if-else-if statements.

<b>How It Works:</b>

User chooses between rock, paper and scissors. 
Now, I use the Random function to generate a number in the range [0,99] and decide computer's 
choice on the basis of it.

Range    --->    Computer's choice

0 - 33		     Rock
33 - 66  	     Paper
66 - 99		     Scissors

Once I have both the choices, I just use the rules to determine the winner.

<b>RULES: </b>

Choice1            Choice 2    ---->    Outcome

Paper		   Rock       ----> 	Paper Wins
Rock		   Scissors    ---->	Rock Wins
Scissors  	   Paper       ----> 	Scissors Wins
